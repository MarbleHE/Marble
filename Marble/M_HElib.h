    /// An HElib-encrypted scalar that behaves like a built-in numerical type as much as possible
    /// The closes analogy would be a float, however there are some subtle differences
    /// It encodes numbers as follows:
    /// There is a (plaintext) scaling factor s
    /// There is a (bit-wise encrypted) integer z, represented in two's complement
    /// The number of bits in z can vary, and the number of bits is public
    /// The value of the HElibScalar is z * 2^s
    /// Since the number of bits in z and the plaintext s are leaked,
    /// some information about the size of the number is revealed
    /// Where this is not acceptable, it is possible to fix the scaling factor
    /// and number of bits used during encryption.
    /// Slightly technical remark:
    /// During computations these numbers might change again
    /// but this change is information leaked by the 'circuit', not the encryption
    /// During computation, no bits are discarded and no rounding occurs
    /// Instead, multiplying e.g. a number where z is 8 bits with one where z is 16 bits
    /// will result in a 24-bit z in the result
    /// This is not the most efficient approach, however it simplifies reasoning about these numbers quite drastically

        *
        * @param	slots			Minimum number of SIMD slots (using CRT batching) that the structure should offer.
        *							Note that the actual number of slots will usually be higher, sometimes significantly so!
        *
        * @param	plaintext_base	The base in which plaintexts should be represented. Usually "2" for binary.
        *
        * @param	r				(Advanced) The power of plaintext_base.
        *							The actual plaintext space in HElib is a Finite Field/Galois Field GF(p^r) where
        *							p = @p plaintext_base. Note that a field GF(p^r) does not behave like e.g. Z_(p^r) would,
        *							but instead behaves like a vector with length r where the coefficients are base-p and operations
        *							are coefficient-wise. Setting this to something other than 1 is only recommended
        *							for advanced users that want to e.g. emulate specific cryptographic fields (e.g. for AES)
        *
        * @param	sec				The desired security level in bits. Will usually be higher than requested.
        *							Note that reserach by M. Albrecht [1] has shown that HElib is actually too optimistic,
        *							and a level of 80 bits as reported by HElib could actually be only 62 bits of security.
