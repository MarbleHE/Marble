/**
* @file bluestein.h
* @brief declaration of BluesteinFFT(x, n, root, powers, powers_aux, Rb):
*
* Compute length-n FFT of the coefficient-vector of x (in place) 
* If the degree of x is less than n then it treats the top coefficients
* as 0, if the degree of x is more than n then the extra coefficients are
* ignored. Similarly, if the top entries in x are zeros then x will have
* degree smaller than n. The argument root is a 2n-th root of unity, namely
* BluesteinFFT(...,root,...)=DFT(...,root^2,...).
*
* The inverse-FFT is obtained just by calling BluesteinFFT(... root^{-1}),
* but this procedure is *NOT SCALED*, so BluesteinFFT(x,n,root,...) and
* then BluesteinFFT(x,n,root^{-1},...) will result in x = n * x_original
*
* The values powers, powers_aux, and Rb must be precomputed by first
* calling BluesteinInit(n, root, powers, powers_aux, Rb).
