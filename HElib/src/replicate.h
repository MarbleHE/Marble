/**
 * @file replicate.h
 * @brief Procedures for replicating a ciphertext slot across a full ciphertext
 *
 * This module implements a recursive, O(1)-amortized algorithm for
 * replications. On an input ciphertext that encrypts (x_1, ..., x_n), we
 * generate the n encrypted vectors (x_1, ..., x_1), ..., (x_n, ..., x_n),
 * in that order.
 *
 * To process the output vectors, a "call back" mechanism is used (so that we
 * do not need to generate them all, and instead can return them one by one).
 * For this purpose, the caller should pass a pointer to a class derived from
 * the purely abstract class ReplicateHandler.
 *
 * The replication procedures are meant to be used for linear algebra operation
 * where a matrix-vector multiplication can be implemented for example by
 * replicating each entry of the vector as a stand-alone ciphertext, then use
 * the SIMD operations on these ciphertexts.

/**
 * replicateAll uses a hybrid strategy, combining the O(log n) strategy of the
 * replicate method, with an O(1) strategy, which is faster but introduces more
 * noise. This tradeoff is controlled by the parameter recBound:
 *
 * \li recBound < 0: recursion to depth |recBound| (faster, noisier)
 * \li recBound ==0: no recursion (slower, less noise)
 * \li recBound > 0: the recursion depth is chosen heuristically,
 *     but is capped at recBound
 * 
 * The default value for recBound is 64, this ensures that the choice is
 * based only on the heuristic, which will introduce noise corresponding to
 * O(log log n) levels of recursion, but still gives an algorithm that
 * theoretically runs in time O(n).
