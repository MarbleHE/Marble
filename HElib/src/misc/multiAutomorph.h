 * The "high level" multiAutomorph implementation below gets as input a
 * ciphertext and a tree as above, and generates all the automorphisms

 * by the order of the std:vector's, even though we use unordered_map
 * for the different vectors. (A cycle in the underlying graph may
 * cause the same rotation amount to be returned more than once.)
