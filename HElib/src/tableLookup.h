 * @function buildLookupTable
 * @brief Built a table-lookup for a function in fixed-point representation
 *
 * FIXED-POINT CONVENTIONS:
 * Fixed-point numbers are specified by a triple (nbits,scale,signed).
 * Such a number is represented as an integer x with nbits bits. If
 * signed == 1, then x is treated as a signed integer in 2's compliment;
 * otherwise it is as an unsigned integer. The value represented by x
 * is x*2^{scale}.
 * 
 * The buildLookupTable function builds a lookup table T, which can be
 * used in conjunction with the tableLookup function above. The size of
 * T will be 2^{nbits_in}. For every signed integer x with bit-size
 * 'nbits_in', we will have
 *     T[x] = f(x * 2^{scale_in}) * 2^{-scale_out}),
 * rounded to the nearest integer and truncated to 'nbits_out' bits.
 * The bits are packed inside the slots, so it is assumed that each
 * slot has enough room to fit these many bits. (Otherwise we only
 * keep as many low-order bits as fit in a slot.)
 *
 * SATURATED ARITHMETIC:
 * Applications of f that return a result that is too large to represent
 * in the output format will be converted to the maximum representable
 * value. Similary, Applications of f that return a result that is too
 * small will be converted to the minimul representable value. (This
 * applies also to applications of f that return infinites, NaNs will
 * just be mapped to zero.) For this to work correctly, you should be
 * working with standard IEEE arithmetic...which will be the case on
 * almost all platforms.
 *
 * EXAMPLE:
 *
 * buildLookupTable(T, [](double x){ return 1/x;},
 *                  nbits_in, scale_in, nbits_out, scale_out, sign_out, ea)
 *
 * will build a lookup table for inversion.
