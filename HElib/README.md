HElib
=====
***March 2018:*** Re-implementation of homomorphic linear transformations, featuring speedups of 15x to 75x.

***Dec 2017-Jan 2018:*** Added some routines for addition/multiplication and
comparisons of integers in binary representation, and for homomorphic table
lookup. See the supported interfaces in `binaryArith.h`, `binaryCompare.h`,
and `tableLookup.h`. Some examples are in `Test_binaryArith.cpp`,
`Test_binaryCompare.cpp`, and `Test_tableLookup.cpp`.

The inputs and putputs to the new routines are logically vectors of Ctxt objects
(one Ctxt per bit in the binary representation). These vectors are wrapped by
the new `CtPtrs` wrapper (see `CtPtrs.h` and the underlying `PtrsVector.h` and
`PtrsMatrix.h`).  Hence the same logic will work for any type of input that can
be mapped logically to arrays of `Ctxt`s, as long as one can wrap them with the
same wrapper class. In particular, we implementated wrappers for
`std::vector<Ctxt>`, `std::vector<Ctxt*>`, `NTL::Vec<Ctxt>` and
`NTL::Vec<Ctxt*>`.

HElib is a software library that implements [homomorphic encryption][6] (HE).
Currently available is an implementation of the
[Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan][1] (BGV) scheme, along with many
optimizations to make homomorphic evaluation runs faster, focusing mostly on
effective use of the [Smart-Vercauteren][2] ciphertext packing techniques and
the [Gentry-Halevi-Smart][3] optimizations. See [this report][7] for a
description of a few of the algorithms using in this library. Starting
December 2014, the library also includes [bootstrapping][8].

At its present state, this library is mostly meant for researchers working on
HE and its uses. Also currently it is fairly low-level, and is best thought of
as "assembly language for HE". That is, it provides low-level routines (set,
add, multiply, shift, etc.), with as much access to optimizations as we can
give. Hopefully in time we will be able to provide higher-level routines.

This library is written in C++ and uses the [NTL mathematical library][4]
(version 10.0.0 or higher). As of March 2015, it also supports multi-threading.
HElib is distributed under the terms of the [Apache License v2.0][5].
